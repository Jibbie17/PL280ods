## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?

To explore if states where Native Americans don't have criminal jurisdiction on tribal lands
experience higher drug-related death rates. It has not changed.

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?

County-level data is very difficul to clean. I have built most of my visualizations to rely
on State-level data. I use no mock data.

## Describe each of the provided images with 2-3 sentences to give the context and how it relates to your goal.

## What form do you envision your final deliverable taking?
An article makes the most sense. The images need a lot of explaining since the topic is complicated.
