# PL280ods
Analyzing AIAN drug related death variation between PL280 and non-PL280 states.
by Gabriel Barrett

# Project Description

My project is examining variation in drug-related deaths amongs the American Indian and Alaskan
Native (AIAN) populations. Specifically I am interested in whether drug-related deaths are higher
on Native American reservations that lack criminal jurisdiction under Public Law 280. Public Law 280
is a law passed in 1953 that gave certain states the ability to assume legal jurisdiction on Native American
Reservations that was otherwise held by the federal government. In the process, it gave the states
jurisdiction over all minor and municipal criminal offenses. In practice what that means is that
a Tribal Authority on a reservation under public law 280 has no authority to enforce municipal laws
unless county law enforcement delegate some authority to it. Tribal Authorities on reservations
not covered by public law 280 can make and enforce their own municipal codes. 

I am researching if the difference in who is responsible for criminal jurisdiction explains variation in drug-related deaths. The idea being that tribal authorities are better able to handle drug use and 
drug distribution on reservations than county authorities. I am conducting this research
as part of my work as an intern with the University of Chicago Health Lab.

The visualizations show clear differences in the AIAN drug related death rate in counties
where Tribes lack criminal jurisdiction and estimated effects get larger as controls are added.
